## What We're Learning This Week

### Technical Concepts
- **CSS Syntax**: Selectors, properties, and values

- **Box Model**: margin, padding, border, content
- **Positioning**: `static`, `relative`, `absolute`, `fixed`
- **Flexbox Layout**: Modern layout system with `display: flex`
- **Responsive Design**: Making interfaces work on all screen sizes

### CSS Properties Focus
- `color`, `background-color` - Visual styling
- `position`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right` - Element positioning
- `display: flex` - Flexible layout system
- `padding`, `margin` - Spacing
- `border-radius`, `box-shadow` - Visual polish

## Career Lesson: "Be prepared to change jobs/settings often - The tech industry is constantly evolving, adaptability is key"

### Why This Matters
The technology industry evolves rapidly:
- New frameworks and tools emerge constantly
- Companies reorganize, pivot, or get acquired
- Job requirements change as technology advances
- Your skills need continuous updating to stay relevant

### Real-World Application
- Build transferable skills (fundamentals over frameworks)
- Document your learning process for future transitions
- Create a portfolio that demonstrates adaptability
- Network and stay connected with the developer community
- Embrace change as an opportunity to grow

## Project State After This Lesson
```

### Practice Challenges
1. **Layout Challenge**: Recreate a popular chat interface using only CSS
2. **Responsive Practice**: Make your chatbot work on phone, tablet, and desktop
3. **Design System**: Create a color palette and consistent spacing system

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Using pixel values for everything (use rem/em for scalability)
- Not testing on different screen sizes early
- Overusing `position: absolute` instead of flexbox
- Forgetting to link stylesheet to HTML
- Copy-pasting CSS without understanding how it works

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### CSS Not Loading
```html
<!-- Make sure link tag is in <head> -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
```

### Styles Not Applying
- Check for typos in class/id names
- Verify selector specificity
- Use browser dev tools to inspect elements
- Clear browser cache

### Layout Breaking on Mobile
- Use relative units (%, rem, em) instead of fixed pixels
- Test with browser dev tools device emulation
- Add viewport meta tag to HTML

## Next Week Preview
