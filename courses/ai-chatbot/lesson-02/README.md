# Lesson 02: Introduction to HTML

## Theme: "Structure Before Style - Building Solid Foundations"

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will:
- Understand HTML document structure and semantic elements
- Know how to use essential HTML tags for building interfaces
- Create the basic structure for a chatbot interface
- Understand the importance of proper HTML semantics

## What We're Learning This Week

### Technical Concepts
- **HTML Document Structure**: `<!DOCTYPE>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`
- **Semantic HTML**: Using the right tags for the right content
- **Form Elements**: `<input>`, `<button>`, `<form>` for user interaction
- **Content Organization**: `<div>`, `<span>`, `<section>` for layout
- **Accessibility**: How proper HTML helps all users

### HTML Tags Focus
- `html`, `head`, `body` - Document structure
- `div`, `span` - Generic containers
- `a`, `img` - Links and media
- `input`, `button`, `form` - User interaction
- `section`, `article`, `main` - Semantic structure

## This Week's Tasks

### 1. HTML Fundamentals
- [ ] Learn proper HTML5 document structure
- [ ] Understand the difference between semantic and generic tags
- [ ] Practice with form elements and user input
- [ ] Explore accessibility considerations

### 2. Chatbot Interface Creation
- [ ] Create semantic HTML structure for chat application
- [ ] Add input field for user messages
- [ ] Add send button for message submission
- [ ] Create message display area with proper containers
- [ ] Implement basic form structure

### 3. Code Quality Practice
- [ ] Use proper indentation and formatting
- [ ] Add meaningful HTML comments
- [ ] Validate HTML structure
- [ ] Test in different browsers

## Career Lesson: "Architecture > coding - Designing the system properly upfront saves months of technical debt"

### Why This Matters
- Good HTML structure is the foundation of maintainable web applications
- Semantic HTML improves accessibility and SEO automatically
- Proper planning prevents major restructuring later
- Clean architecture makes collaboration with designers and other developers easier

### Real-World Application
- Always wireframe your interface before coding
- Choose semantic HTML elements based on meaning, not appearance
- Consider how your structure will scale with new features
- Document your architectural decisions for team members

## Project State After This Lesson
```
chatbot-project/
├── index.html (complete chatbot interface structure)
├── README.md
└── .git/
```

Your HTML should include:
- Proper document structure with semantic elements
- Input field for typing messages
- Send button for message submission
- Message display area ready for styling
- Form element connecting input and button

## Additional Resources

### Essential Reading
- [MDN HTML Element Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element)
- [HTML5 Semantic Elements Guide](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp)
- [Web Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/)

### Practice Challenges
1. **Structure Challenge**: Build a news article layout using only semantic HTML
2. **Form Practice**: Create a contact form with proper input types and labels
3. **Accessibility Test**: Use a screen reader to navigate your chatbot interface

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Using `<div>` for everything instead of semantic elements
- Forgetting to include proper labels for form inputs
- Not considering keyboard navigation
- Mixing presentation with structure (that's CSS's job!)

## Next Week Preview
In Lesson 03, we'll add CSS styling to make our chatbot interface beautiful and functional. We'll learn about positioning, flexbox, and responsive design.

## Homework
1. Complete the chatbot HTML structure
2. Validate your HTML using W3C validator
3. Test your interface with keyboard navigation only
4. Research 3 examples of well-structured chat interfaces online
5. Commit your work with a descriptive commit message
