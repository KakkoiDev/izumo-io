- Learning to "finish" projects builds reputation and confidence

### Real-World Application
- Always include README files with clear setup instructions
- Create demo environments that actually work for stakeholders
- Document your architectural decisions and trade-offs
- Practice explaining technical concepts to non-technical audiences
- Build a portfolio that tells the story of your growth as a developer
