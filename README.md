# Izumo.io

**Building the next generation of developers through hands-on, project-based learning.**

## What is Izumo.io?

Izumo.io is a learning platform dedicated to teaching software development through practical, real-world projects. We believe in learning by building - not just reading or watching, but actually creating working applications from scratch.

Our philosophy:
- **Start from zero**: No prior experience required
- **Build real projects**: Every lesson contributes to a complete application
- **Learn by doing**: Hands-on coding from day one
- **Career-ready skills**: Practical knowledge you'll use in your job
- **Community support**: Learn together with peers and mentors
