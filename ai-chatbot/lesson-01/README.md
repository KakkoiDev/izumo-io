- [ ] Understand the difference between frontend and backend
- [ ] See how AI tools can assist in daily development workflow

## Career Lesson: "Preparing specifications first - Always plan before you code to avoid chaos and rework"

### Why This Matters
In software development, rushing into coding without proper setup and planning leads to:
- Wasted time fixing environment issues later
- Inconsistent development across team members
- Missing requirements that require major rewrites
- Technical debt that accumulates over time

### Real-World Application
- Always spend time setting up your development environment properly
- Document your setup process for team members
- Create project specifications before writing the first line of code
- Use standardized tools and configurations across projects

## Project State After This Lesson
At the end of Week 1, your project should have:
```
chatbot-project/
├── index.html (basic "Hello World" page)
├── README.md (project description)
└── .git/ (version control initialized)
```

## Additional Resources

### Essential Reading
- [MDN Web Docs - Getting Started](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web)
- [Git Handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/)
- [VS Code Getting Started](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/getting-started)

### Video Tutorials
- "How the Internet Works" - Basic networking concepts
- "Git and GitHub for Beginners" - Version control fundamentals
- "Setting Up a Development Environment" - Best practices

### Practice Challenges
1. **Environment Test**: Create a simple HTML page that displays your name and favorite programming quote
2. **Git Practice**: Make 5 commits with meaningful commit messages
3. **Tool Exploration**: Try using Ollama to help explain a programming concept

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Git Configuration Problems
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

### VS Code Extensions Not Working
- Restart VS Code after installing extensions
- Check extension compatibility with your VS Code version
- Look for conflicting extensions

### Ollama Installation Issues
- Ensure your system meets minimum requirements
- Check firewall settings if model downloads fail
- Try different models if one doesn't work

## Next Week Preview
In Lesson 02, we'll dive into HTML structure and start building the actual chatbot interface. We'll learn about semantic HTML and create the foundation for our chat application.

## Homework
1. Complete all setup tasks in the checklist
2. Create your first HTML page with proper structure
3. Make at least 3 commits to practice Git workflow
4. Join the Discord and introduce yourself with your learning goals
5. Experiment with asking Ollama development questions
